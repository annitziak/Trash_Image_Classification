# 1.Predicting Waste Through Image Recognition

### TrashNet Dataset Overview
[Trashnet] (https://universe.roboflow.com/polygence-project/trashnet-a-set-of-annotated-images-of-trash-that-can-be-used-for-object-detection/browse?queryText=&pageSize=50&startingIndex=0&browseQuery=true)

- **Content**: The dataset comprises 2,527 images categorized into six classes: cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash.
- Previous work includes:
  **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**:
    - *AlexNet*: Modifying the AlexNet architecture, one study achieved a test accuracy of approximately 79.94% when combined with an SVM classifier.

- **DenseNet Architectures**:
    - Implementations of DenseNet121 and DenseNet169, optimized with the Adam optimizer and data augmentation techniques, have demonstrated superior test accuracies compared to other models.

### Current Research Landscape

- **Deep Learning Models**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been extensively employed for waste classification tasks. For instance, a study utilizing a modified ResNet-50 architecture achieved a classification accuracy of 92.4% on the TrashNet dataset.

- **Multi-Label Classification**: Recent efforts have addressed the complexity of real-world waste, where images may contain multiple waste types. A Vision Transformer-based model achieved an accuracy exceeding 92.36% on a municipal waste dataset containing images with up to four waste categories.

    ## Literature Gap
    
    **Multi-Label Classification Challenges**: Although progress has been made, accurately classifying images containing multiple waste items is still complex. Developing models that can effectively handle overlapping objects and varying spatial arrangements is an ongoing research area.
    
# 2. Sentiment Analysis Example
    
    ### **Dataset**
    
    - **e.g. IMDb Movie Reviews**:
        - **Content**: The dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. The data is evenly split into training and testing sets, with 25,000 reviews each.
        - **Challenges**: Sentences vary in length, structure, and complexity, presenting challenges for sequential models like RNNs and Transformers.

    ### **1. Yelp Reviews Dataset**

    #### **Content**
    The Yelp Reviews Dataset contains text reviews and metadata from Yelp, including ratings on a scale of 1 to 5 stars.
    
    - **Features**:
      - Text reviews for businesses across various categories (restaurants, shops, services).
      - Ratings (1â€“5 stars).
      - Metadata: business category, location, and review time.
    
    #### **Challenges**
    - Handling imbalanced classes as most reviews are either very positive or very negative.
    - Managing domain-specific language (e.g., slang, regional terms).
    
    #### **Models**
    - **LSTM**: Analyze sequential dependencies in review text.
    - **GRU**: A lighter alternative for faster processing.
    - **Transformers**: Use pre-trained models like RoBERTa for nuanced understanding.

    ### **2. Airline Sentiment Dataset**
    
    #### **Content**
    This dataset includes tweets about major U.S. airlines labeled with sentiments (positive, neutral, negative).
    
    - **Features**:
      - Short textual data in the form of tweets.
      - Sentiment labels (positive, neutral, negative).
      - Metadata: tweet timestamp, airline name, and reason for sentiment.
    
    #### **Challenges**
    - Imbalanced classes (e.g., more negative than positive tweets).
    - Short text sequences with abbreviations and hashtags.
    
    #### **Models**
    - **LSTM**: Captures sequential dependencies in tweets.
    - **GRU**: Efficient for short sequences.
    - **Transformers**: Fine-tune BERT or DistilBERT for text classification.
